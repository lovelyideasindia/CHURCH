1. Silent night, holy night, All is calm, all is bright; you, Round yon virgin mother and Child! Holy Infant, so tender and mild, on ebooit bas Sleep in heavenly peace, Sleep in heavenly peace.s3068

2. Silent night, holy night, Darkness flies, all is light; Shepherds hear the angels sing, "Alleluial hail the King! Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born"

3. Silent night, holy night, Son of God, love's pure light; Radiant beams from Thy holy face, With the dawn of redeeming grace Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth, Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

4. Silent night, holy night, Wondrous star, lend thy light; With the angels let us sing, Alleluia to our King; Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born. o
