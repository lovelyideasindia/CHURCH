1 There came a little Child to earth
Long ago;
And the angels of God proclaimed His birth,
High and low.

2 Out in the night so calm and still,
Their song was heard;
For they knew that the Child on Bethleh'mâ€™s hill
Was Christ the Lord.

3 Far away in the goodly land
Fair and bright;
Children with crowns of glory stand,
Robed in white.

4 They sing, the Lord of heaven so fair,
A Child was born;
And that they might His crown of glory share,
Wore crown of thorn.

5 In mortal weakness, want and pain,
He came to die,
That the children of earth might in glory reign
With Him on high.

6 And evermore in robes so fair
And undefiled,
Those ransomed children His praise declare,
Who was a Child.
